# Health Data Analytics Using SAS

## Overview
Analyzed a large-scale healthcare dataset (N=3,400) to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments across different patient groups. Used SAS procedures to clean data, compare treatment outcomes, and validate findings statistically.

## Tools Used
- SAS (PROC MEANS, PROC ANOVA, PROC TTEST)
- Excel (for initial exploration)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Hypothesis Testing
- Descriptive Statistics
- One-Way ANOVA
- Independent t-test
- Clinical Outcome Interpretation

## Project Steps
1. Imported and cleaned a 3400-row healthcare dataset in SAS.
2. Performed descriptive analysis using PROC MEANS and PROC FREQ.
3. Conducted one-way ANOVA to compare group means across treatments.
4. Ran independent t-tests to validate significant treatment outcomes.
5. Visualized outputs and interpreted confidence intervals.

## Outcome
Identified treatment efficacy with 95% confidence across multiple clinical groups. Demonstrated practical SAS application in health data analytics.
